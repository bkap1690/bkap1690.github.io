            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              While owning any dog can be a challenging, albeit rewarding experience, city dwellers looking to adopt
              their furr-ever friends have more constraints on them than their rural counterparts. Potential owners have
              to consider many factors such as the size of the dog, breed, temperament & disposition, and of course, the
              age, to name a few. Also, owners have to consider their lifestyle to ensure the dog won't be neglected.
              Taking the above into account, city-goers find it difficult to find a dog that's right for them.

                I designed an onboarding / user intake experience where the user answers questions to narrow down their
                preferences, searching for a dog. The goal of the user is not just to find out what kind of dog they
                want, but more specifically, what kind of dog a user should consider based on a multitude of factors
                including location, lifestyle, hobbies, work-life balance, dog size, dog temperament, and dog health.

                I researched the market for products that catered to pet adoption to see what worked and what didn't
                work. I came across three websites; Rover & Petfinder were pet-oriented sites and Apartment List was
                an apartment-finder site
                that had great inspiration for a user-preference flow.

                      <li>
                        Since most adoption sites focus on making a connection between people and dogs, she falls in
                        love with a dog that needs more space, attention, or activity than she can provide, ultimately
                        leading to disappointment, and more indecision.

                      <li>
                        Descriptions of dogs on sites are too general - for example, it may say "this dog doesn't
                        require a lot of space" - but how small is too small?

                With the persona, competitive analysis, and interview data, I began to flesh out ideas of potential
                solutions using some sketching excercises. I started with the sketch excercise, Crazy 8s, to get an
                idea on paper. I stuck to drawing the preference input flow because I thought that was the pertinent
                part of the solution.

                In order to get more granular feedback from users on the higher level user goals, I asked users to
                consider several scenarios and to find the best way to achieve an end goal. These included:

              <ul class="font-italic">

                <li>Once you have results of various dogs, you want to view more information about a specific dog as

                <li>After searching through a few dogs, you decide you want to expand the distance of how far you're

                <li>After viewing some information on a dog, you think you've found a great pup and you want to

              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                I gathered a lot of positive feedback on the prototype, from users with different preferences for dog
                types,
                different lifestyle constraints, and various attitudes towards certain dog attributes Here's a summary
                of how well people were able to complete tasks in the different scenarious above as well as users'
                comments on the app overall.

              <ul class="font-italic">
                <li>Users were able to complete tasks such as choosing preferences for dogs within the intake flow,
                  viewing pictures/videos and more information on a speciifc dog, adjusting the filters for results, and
                  were able to schedule an appointment with a rep. </li>
                <li>Several users commented on having the ability to choose more than one option for amount of distance
                  willing to travel, and their lifestyle (since people don't fit into one lifestyle usually). </li>
                <li>Other users noted that the intake flow could contain more questions regarding vaccinations,
                  personality, trained or not, breed selection options, and the ability to choose between adoption
                  agencies. All of these were great suggestions that I would 100% consider adding into the next design
                  sprint.</li>

              The next steps in designing this interface will be to make the edits users gave feedback on in the

              personality so users
              can filter down further to find their perfect companion.

              Another feature I intend to add in the next iteration for usability testing will be map interactivity so
