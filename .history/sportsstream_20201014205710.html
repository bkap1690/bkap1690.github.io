            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              There's no love like that of a love for a sports team. As odd as it may seem, and irrational as it may be,
              people love their sports teams more than some family members. Originally from New York, I moved out to Los
              Angeles a few years ago and began to feel frustrated because I could no longer watch any of my New York
              teams on cable or streaming platforms.

              <br>
              <br>

              Sports fans alike go through similar troubles. If their
              team did play a nationally televised game, they need to have cable in order to watch it which can be
              expensive. Streaming platforms, while cheaper, most likely don't have teams to choose from to watch. As a
              last resort, fans may stream the game online only to find a website riddled with
              advertisements, that takes too long to load, and is generally poorer quality than streaming and cable.

            <h3 class="img-subhead text-center">
              Frustrating experiences like these leave fans to fend for themselves and frustrated and in some cases
              leading them to ditch watching sports altogether.

              <p>
                I designed A sports streaming app that allows users to watch all sports in one central location. The UI
                will be clean and intuitive, displaying personalized content based on user location, preferences,
                behavior, and viewing styles.

                            heart for Ohio sports. When he wants to tune into those games, he browses specific websites
                            to find free streams of games.

                            Since most packages are tied to cable providers or other streaming services, he finds it
                            hard to commit and again it is very expensive to keep up. In the end, he wonders if it is
                            worth it.

                After gaining feedback from surveys, interviews,and secondary research, I moved to the design phase

                screens.

                From the empathy diagram and personas I created, I came to the decision that subscription management,
                registration/onboarding where users can choose their sports and teams, and watching a stream experiences
                were focal points of the overall app experience. I mapped out user flows of those 3 experiences based on
                the research I had completed thus far to see how users navigated the decision-making process.

                large thumbnails for choosing sports, teams, and subscription types. The intention was to give users
                easily digestible information.

                The style guide was challenging because I wanted to find the right balance between sporty, fresh, and
                minimal design. I gathered some mood board material for some inspiration.
              </p>
              <div class="w-xl-100 w-lg-100 w-md-100 w-sm-100 mx-auto py-5">
                <img class="w-100" src="assets/sportsstream_moodboard-transparent 2.png" alt="Moodboard">
              </div>
              <p class="py-5">
                Ultimately I went with a blue and red color scheme with some grayscale as well to have a balance of
                trust but also drive associated with sports. I chose Noto Sans TC as the font because it had a good
                balance of sleek but strong for a sports fan. I created a style guide to ensure I stayed on brand with
                my colors and typography.

            <p>
              For the initial iteration, my goal was to validate if the initial onboarding experience guided users
              efficiently through the inputs, the home tab where users can select streams to watch was pleasing to the
              user, the watch stream viewing interface provided simple interactions such as play, pause, etc., and
              changing subscription settings made sense for the user. Ideally, everything should make sense for the user
              but I wanted to make sure the subscription settings especially did so because it was a sticking point for
              users in the interviews and surveys.
              <br>
              <br>
              I also wanted to identify any obstacles or hesitations users found while performing certain tasks. If
              there were any, they would need to be addressed in future rounds of usability tests and iterations.

              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>
                After creating the hi-fi screens I conducted several rounds of usability tests to see where I could
                improve upon the design and functionality of the app.
                <br>
                <br>
                Round 1 came away with the following conclusions:
              </p>
              <ul class="font-italic">
                <li>Overall, the flow of the app was good. Users seemed to be able to move around the app and complete
                  tasks such as unsubscribing, onboarding, and watching a game easily.
                </li>
                <li>The Home and Watch tabs needed to be renamed or one needed to be removed. Users had a hard time
                  distinguishing between the two.
                </li>
                <li>In the first iteration of the prototype, the Subscription “toggle” switch to pause a subscription
                  confused users.
                </li>
                <li>Tapping to pause on the full screen view of a game wasn’t clearly accessible. The controls needed to
                  be visible for a brief period to notify users that that is an available feature, similar to YouTube.
                </li>
                <li>The Subscription card features needed to be presented. Users wanted to know what was under each
                  category so they had a better idea of where they were going.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I made the necessary changes and performed another round of testing with several more users. The
                additional testing helped me further fine tune anything that might need some attention.
                <br>
                <br>
                Round 2 came away with additional conclusions:
              </p>
              <ul class="font-italic">
                <li>The Subscription Page Needed Interaction within the prototype.
                </li>
                <li>Confirmation messages were needed after successfully creating an account, cancel or pausing a
                  subscription, or any errors states in general.
                </li>
                <li>Trending could be a nice feature as a tab where a user could access the latest trending topics.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I made some minor changes adding confirmation messages and I thought the trending tab instead of Home
                tab was a really good idea. I added interaction within the choosing teams onboarding section and the
                changing subscription sections to make the experience an immersive one.

              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                I gathered a lot of positive feedback on the prototype, from users with different preferences for dog
                types,
                different lifestyle constraints, and various attitudes towards certain dog attributes Here's a summary
                of how well people were able to complete tasks in the different scenarious above as well as users'
                comments on the app overall.
              </p>
              <ul class="font-italic">
                <li>Users were able to complete tasks such as choosing preferences for dogs within the intake flow,
                  viewing pictures/videos and more information on a speciifc dog, adjusting the filters for results, and
                  were able to schedule an appointment with a rep. </li>
                <li>Several users commented on having the ability to choose more than one option for amount of distance
                  willing to travel, and their lifestyle (since people don't fit into one lifestyle usually). </li>
                <li>Other users noted that the intake flow could contain more questions regarding vaccinations,
                  personality, trained or not, breed selection options, and the ability to choose between adoption
                  agencies. All of these were great suggestions that I would 100% consider adding into the next design
                  sprint.</li>

            <p class="text-dark">
              The journey in creating the app was a long and arduous one that presented a ton of challenges. In the end,
              I had to go back and forth on design, functionality, and what the most important features of the app
              should be. I think the hardest part in designing for the user is getting bogged down with the minutia of
              things. It’s good to be detailed oriented but designing for detail at every step of the process could
              hinder the outcome of having a really useful product that is centered around the user.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
              In the end I would have had a product
              where you injected a lot of goodies you thought were cool but didn’t reflect what users were saying. I
              know for myself, I wanted to design so many “cool” features but had to reign myself in to focus more on
              the MVP, what information users were giving me in the research stage, and designing for the user not what
              I wanted.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
              Going back to the research, surveys, and interviews helped keep me on track. Whenever I would go slightly
              astray, I reminded myself to come back to the research to keep my design on track and user-focused.

              The final MVP prototype came out really well I think but can definitely be improved upon. There’s a bunch
              of ideas I have circling around in my head on what could be implemented in future designs. Alas, the next
              steps will be to test more and see how users are responding. If any new features are to be put into the
              app, I’ll use an agile approach to my process by testing and creating and testing some more.
